Logback: the reliable, generic, fast and flexible logging framework. <br/>

<b>MMS uses [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/license/) https://wordpress.org/about/license/</b><br/>
GNU Public License<br/>
The license under which the WordPress software is released is the GPLv2<br/>
(or later) from the Free Software Foundation. A copy of the license is<br/>
included with every copy of WordPress, but you can also read the text<br/>
of the license here.<br/>
Part of this license outlines requirements for derivative works, such <br/>
as plugins or themes. Derivatives of WordPress code inherit the GPL <br/>
license. Drupal, which has the same GPL license as WordPress, has an <br/>
excellent page on licensing as it applies to themes and modules (their <br/>
word for plugins).<br/>
There is some legal grey area regarding what is considered a derivative <br/>
work, but we feel strongly that plugins and themes are derivative work<br/>
and thus inherit the GPL license. If you disagree, you might want to<br/>
consider a non-GPL platform such as Serendipity (BSD license) or Habari <br/>
(Apache license) instead.<br/>
